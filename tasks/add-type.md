<purpose>
Guide the creation of a new project type for SEED's composable data layer — produces guide.md, config.md, and skill-loadout.md in a new data/{type}/ directory.
</purpose>

<user-story>
As a builder with a project category SEED doesn't cover, I want to add a custom type with its own conversation guide and rigor settings, so that /seed ideate gives me type-appropriate guidance for my specific kind of project.
</user-story>

<when-to-use>
- The 5 default types (application, workflow, client, utility, campaign) don't fit your project
- You have a recurring project category that deserves its own guided flow
- You want type-specific rigor, demeanor, and section structure
</when-to-use>

<context>
@{~/.qwen/commands/qwen-seed/data/application/guide.md} (reference for guide structure)
@{~/.qwen/commands/qwen-seed/data/application/config.md} (reference for config structure)
@{~/.qwen/commands/qwen-seed/data/application/skill-loadout.md} (reference for loadout structure)
</context>

<steps>

<step name="get_type_name" priority="first">
## Name the Type

Ask for the new type name — lowercase, hyphenated, singular (e.g., "microservice", "chrome-extension", "course").

Check if `data/{name}/` already exists:
- **If exists:** "{name} already exists as a type. Want to edit it, or pick a different name?"
- **If new:** Proceed.

Show existing types for reference:
> "Current types: application, workflow, client, utility, campaign"
> "What's the new type called?"

Wait for response.
</step>

<step name="define_sections">
## Define Conversation Sections

Ask the user to define the conversation sections for this type. These become the guide.md structure.

> "What sections should the ideation conversation cover for a **{type}** project?"
>
> For reference, here's how existing types are structured:
> - Application: 10 sections (Problem, Stack, Data Model, API, Deployment, Security, UI/UX, Integrations, Phases, Skill Loadout)
> - Utility: 6 sections (Problem, Scope Guard, User, Dependencies, Interface, Done Criteria)
>
> List your sections in order of importance. Each will get an Explore prompt and a Suggest prompt.

Wait for response.
</step>

<step name="define_config">
## Configure Rigor and Demeanor

Ask about the type's personality:

> "How should SEED behave during **{type}** ideation?"
>
> **Rigor level:** (how thorough)
> - `tight` — Fast, resist expansion (like utilities)
> - `standard` — Balanced exploration (like workflows, clients)
> - `deep` — Thorough, architecture matters (like applications)
> - `creative` — Loose, generative (like campaigns)
>
> **Demeanor:** One sentence describing the coaching style for this type.
>
> **Required sections:** Which of your sections must be covered? (Others become optional)

Wait for response.
</step>

<step name="create_guide">
## Create Guide File

Generate `data/{type}/guide.md` with the user's sections. For each section:

```markdown
## Section {N}: {Name}
**Explore:** {question prompts based on what the user described}
**Suggest:** {coaching suggestions — what to offer when the user is stuck}
**Depth:** {required | optional}
```

Present the draft guide for review:

> "Here's the conversation guide I drafted for **{type}**. Each section has an Explore prompt and a Suggest prompt. Anything to adjust?"

Wait for response.

Apply any edits the user requests before writing.
</step>

<step name="create_supporting_files">
## Create Config and Skill Loadout

**Create data/{type}/config.md:**
```markdown
# {Type} — Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Rigor | {from step 3} |
| Demeanor | {from step 3} |
| Sections | {count} |

## Required Sections
- {list from step 3}

## Optional Sections
- {list from step 3}
```

**Create data/{type}/skill-loadout.md:**

> "Which ecosystem tools are useful for **{type}** projects? Here are some options:"
> - PAUL, AEGIS, Skillsmith, ui-ux-pro-max, sonarqube
> - business-context-extractor, revops-expert, content-manager
> - content-flywheel-strategist, geo
>
> "List the relevant ones with priority (required/recommended/optional)."

Wait for response.

Write the skill-loadout.md with the user's selections.
</step>

<step name="confirm_and_report">
## Confirm

Report what was created:

```
New type created: {type}

Files:
  data/{type}/guide.md        ({N} sections)
  data/{type}/config.md       (rigor: {level})
  data/{type}/skill-loadout.md

The type is immediately available. Run /seed {type} to try it.
No other files need to change — composable data layer.
```
</step>

</steps>

<output>
- `data/{type}/guide.md` — conversation sections with Explore + Suggest
- `data/{type}/config.md` — rigor, demeanor, required/optional sections
- `data/{type}/skill-loadout.md` — ecosystem tool recommendations
</output>

<acceptance-criteria>
- [ ] New type name validated (lowercase, no collision)
- [ ] Guide created with Explore + Suggest per section
- [ ] Config created with rigor level and required/optional sections
- [ ] Skill loadout created with prioritized tool recommendations
- [ ] Wait points at every user input boundary
- [ ] New type immediately usable without modifying other files
- [ ] Existing types shown as reference during creation
</acceptance-criteria>
