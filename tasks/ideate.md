<purpose>
Guide a user through type-aware collaborative ideation, producing a populated PLANNING.md document ready for graduation or PAUL-managed build.
</purpose>

<user-story>
As a builder with a raw idea, I want guided exploration shaped by my project type, so that I produce a structured PLANNING.md without missing critical design decisions.
</user-story>

<when-to-use>
- Starting a new project and need to shape the idea before building
- Have a vague concept that needs structure and scoping
- Want type-specific guidance (app vs utility vs campaign needs different depth)
- Ready to produce a PLANNING.md for `/seed graduate` or `/seed launch`
</when-to-use>

<context>
@{~/.qwen/commands/seed/seed.md}
`data/{type}/guide.md` (loaded after type selection)
`data/{type}/config.md` (loaded after type selection)
`data/{type}/skill-loadout.md` (loaded during skill loadout step)
`templates/planning-{type}.md` (loaded during output generation)
@{~/.qwen/commands/seed/checklists/planning-quality.md} (referenced as quality gate before output)
</context>

<steps>

<step name="determine_type" priority="first">
## Determine Project Type

Check `$ARGUMENTS` for a type match:

| Input | Type |
|-------|------|
| `application`, `app` | application |
| `workflow` | workflow |
| `client` | client |
| `utility`, `tool` | utility |
| `campaign`, `content` | campaign |

**If match found:** Confirm with user — "Sounds like an **{type}** project. That right?"

**If no match or empty:** Ask the user to describe what they're building in a sentence or two. Then suggest the best-fit type with reasoning:

> "Based on what you described, this sounds like a **{type}** project — {one-line reason}. Does that fit?"

Use these signals to route:

| Type | Signals |
|------|---------|
| Application | Has UI, data model, API, deployment — software people use |
| Workflow | Commands, hooks, CARL domains, templates — Claude Code tooling |
| Client | Website for a client — business context, conversion, content |
| Utility | Small tool, script, single-purpose — resists expansion |
| Campaign | Content, marketing, launches — timeline-driven, not code-driven |

Wait for response before proceeding.
</step>

<step name="get_project_name">
## Get Project Name

Ask for a project name — lowercase, hyphenated. This becomes the directory name under `projects/`.

Check if `projects/{name}/` already exists:
- **If exists:** "There's already a `projects/{name}/` directory. Want to continue that existing ideation, or pick a different name?"
- **If new:** Create `projects/{name}/` directory.

Wait for response.
</step>

<step name="load_type_context">
## Load Type Context

Read the composable data files for the selected type:

1. Read `data/{type}/guide.md` — conversation sections for this type
2. Read `data/{type}/config.md` — rigor level, demeanor, required vs optional sections

**Adopt the coach persona for the rest of this session:**

You are a project coach. Brainstorm alongside the user — offer concrete suggestions when they're stuck, push toward decisions when it's time, let ideas breathe when they need space. You are NOT an interrogator firing questions. You're a thinking partner who happens to know the ecosystem.

Adapt your approach based on config.md:
- **Tight rigor** (utilities): Move fast, resist scope creep, keep it small
- **Standard rigor** (workflows, clients): Balanced exploration, clear boundaries
- **Deep rigor** (applications): Thorough exploration, architecture matters
- **Creative rigor** (campaigns): Loose, generative, timeline-focused
</step>

<step name="guided_conversation">
## Guided Exploration

Work through the sections defined in `data/{type}/guide.md`. These are conversation prompts, not a questionnaire.

**Rules of engagement:**
- Present 1-2 related sections at a time, not all at once
- Adapt based on discussion flow — skip sections the user has already addressed naturally
- Circle back to sections that need more depth
- Offer concrete suggestions: "For this type of app, most teams use X because..." or "Given your audience, you might consider Y"
- If the user is stuck, propose a direction: "Here's one way this could work: ..."
- If the user is going too broad, gently constrain: "That's ambitious — what's the minimum slice that proves the concept?"

**Section groups (from guide.md):**

Work through the guide sections in logical groups. After presenting each group and discussing:

Wait for response.

Continue until all required sections (per config.md) are covered, or the user signals they're ready to wrap up.

<if condition="user signals readiness before all sections covered">
Check config.md for required vs optional sections. If required sections are missing, note them: "We haven't covered {section} yet — that's usually important for {type} projects. Want to hit that quickly, or skip it?"
</if>
</step>

<step name="skill_loadout">
## Skill Loadout

Read `data/{type}/skill-loadout.md` for recommended ecosystem tools.

Present the recommended skills for this project type:

> "For a **{type}** project, these tools from the ecosystem are worth considering:"
> - {skill 1} — {why}
> - {skill 2} — {why}

Ask if any resonate or if they want to note specific tools for the build phase.

Wait for response.
</step>

<step name="generate_planning">
## Generate PLANNING.md

When the user is ready (all sections covered or user signals completion):

1. Read `templates/planning-{type}.md` for output structure
2. Reference `checklists/planning-quality.md` — verify the content is rich enough for headless PAUL init
3. Populate the template with content from the conversation
4. Write to `projects/{name}/PLANNING.md`
5. Fill in the metadata block (Type, Skill Loadout, Quality Gates)

Present the completed PLANNING.md to the user for review.

> "Here's the PLANNING.md I've drafted from our conversation. Take a look — anything to adjust before we lock it in?"

Wait for response.

<if condition="user requests changes">
Apply edits and re-present. Repeat until user approves.
</if>
</step>

<step name="update_tracking">
## Update Tracking & Report

After user approves the PLANNING.md:

1. Update `.base/ACTIVE.md` (if BASE is present) with a new entry:
   ```
   ### {Project Name}
   - **Location:** `projects/{name}/`
   - **Type:** {type}
   - **Status:** Ideation complete — ready for `/seed graduate`
   - **Next:** `/seed graduate {name}` or `/seed launch {name}`
   ```

2. Report completion:
   ```
   Created: projects/{name}/PLANNING.md ({type} template)
   Updated: ACTIVE.md

   Next steps:
   - `/seed graduate {name}` — move to apps/ with git init
   - `/seed launch {name}` — graduate + initialize PAUL for managed build
   ```
</step>

</steps>

<output>
- `projects/{name}/PLANNING.md` — populated type-specific planning document
- `ACTIVE.md` entry (if BASE present)
- Location: `projects/{name}/`
</output>

<acceptance-criteria>
- [ ] Type determined before any substantive ideation begins
- [ ] Type-specific data files loaded and used to shape conversation
- [ ] Conversation is collaborative (coach), not interrogative (questionnaire)
- [ ] Wait points present at every user input boundary
- [ ] Existing project detection prevents silent overwrites
- [ ] PLANNING.md generated from type-specific template
- [ ] Planning quality checklist referenced before output
- [ ] ACTIVE.md updated with new project entry
</acceptance-criteria>
